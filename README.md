# delivery-system-nearest-neighbor
School project with a delivery system to find best route to deliver packages based on parameters.

Currently, packages are hardcoded into trucks based on parameters. Would like to find alternate ways of determining which truck packages should be on.

Currently uses nearest neighbor algorithm to determine which package to deliver next. Would like to use more complex algorithms to determine best route to deliver packages.
